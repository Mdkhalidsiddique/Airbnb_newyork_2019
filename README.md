# Airbnb_newyork_2019
Airbnb is an online marketplace for arranging or offering lodging, primarily homestays, or tourism experiences since 2008. NYC is the most populous city in the United States and also one of the most popular tourism and business place in the world.

Airbnb NYC 2019 data contains listing activity and metrics. In this kernel, I would like to choose the best prediction model for price. Meanwhile, price feature's relationship examines with others and some data exploratory analysis will be made.
